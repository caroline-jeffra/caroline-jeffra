# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Profile

Iâ€™m a full stack developer with more than 10 years of experience in academic research and data management. After finding an affinity and passion for development, I completed a 9-week intensive web development bootcamp with Le Wagon Amsterdam. I bring with me deep experience in managing and organizing complex data as well as a proven track record of successful team collaboration. While I am continuing to upskill through a solo project, I am seeking full-time employment as a full stack developer.
