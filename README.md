# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with varied experience looking to grow professionally through new challenges and in new domains. I'm known for my persistence in tackling tough issues and for looking at the horizon to head off problems before they arise. With my research background, I always love the chance to take a deep dive into topics which are new to me. 

You can find more about what I'm up to and what I'm thinking about on my [github.io page](https://caroline-jeffra.github.io/). It's a work in progress, but isn't everything?
